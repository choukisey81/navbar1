                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[2] GAHN-dee; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an
                    Indian lawyer,[3] anti-colonial nationalist[4] and political ethicist[5] who employed nonviolent
                    resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule,[6] and to
                    later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā
                    (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used
                    throughout the world.Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law
                    at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain
                    years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in
                    1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.</p>
